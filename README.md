# MY BOOK BAS
My group is planning to create an online library that will provide easy access to a wide selection of books in various formats. The project is aimed at meeting the needs of different user groups—students, researchers, educators, and anyone interested in reading. We are developing a system that will allow users to search for and read books online, as well as track their reading history and save bookmarks.
